                I would describe myself as vibrant and outgoing as a person. I enjoy helping other people develop their understanding of concepts or otherwise learn new skills. I am creative by nature and love bringing my projects to live, especially when working in a team where everyone provides feedback and additional ideas. I am interested in many different fields however my primary focus is Telecommunications where I hope to eventually delve in Cyber Security and Networking. I find the subject of innovation to be fascinating as well as constructing the target audience through imagining what users from the various communities I have engaged with would like to use.
