                When my teacher asked our grade 10 class who likes math, I was the only kid to put there hand up, to my utter embarassment. As I have continued to study the subject at university, I have realised that even though when I was at school I thought I was good at math, it extends far beyond what I may ever be able to understand however I can also accept that there are limits. When I do understand how all of the new, crazy things I learn at University work it is always so rewarding however becomes increasingly challenging as I am completing a second year subject and ponder what third year maths could possibly entail.

                In order my prefered sciences are biology, physics, chemistry. I do not have much to do with biology these days except for when I tutor my grade 11 student who seems to be picking it up pretty well.

                 I have had a lot of experience trying out different coding languages such as C, C++, Matlab (personal favourite), R, Java, HTML,CSS and Python. However, I do believe that my general understanding of how the code works has room for refinement. When I started out I thought that the cheapest way to create something in engineering is to create it on your computer and that way you don't have to pay for materials. However this was definitely mistaken as various platforms can add up the costs.

                 I have had experience with building and analysing circuits over the last few years and have even tried out soldering. As the schematics are visual representations of how to structure the components I find that interpreting them comes somewhat naturally.

               	<p>I have participated in 5 hackathons so far, 1 pitching competition and a law innovation program. There have been many highs and lows throughout the course of all of these events however I believe I have gained so much from them and brainstormed a bunch of cool ideas with the teams I was with. My DEVPOST has a record of the main competitions I participated in.

               	<p>I was raised in a pentecostal household however the rules were very rigid and I did not understand why I had to do various things. So eventuall as I journeyed through life I decided to read loads of books on various concepts pertaining to the philosophy of life rather than just the Bible and regularly watch some very big thinkers on youtube.

               	<p>My primary instrument was piano however I have gotten rusty at it and lately sing and play guitar as I do not usually have access to a piano. I believe self expression is very important and having multiple ways to do so can really reduce stress.

              <p>Art is a very deep, personal activity for me as I am able to engage with what I am feeling and express it through strokes on a page. You can usually tell how I feel about someone after I have done a portrait of them. Another odd thing that happens is sometimes when I do a portait of a celebrity it will start to look like friends I have known from when I was younger before I moved to Sydney.</p>
